# Coverage

- Lambda Calculus
- OCaml
  - Basic Types and Expressions
  - Functions and Recursion
  - Working with Lists
  - Algebraic Data Types
  - Higher Order Functions

---

# Lambda Calculus

- Essential syntax / semantics
- Abstract Syntax Trees
- Free/Bound variables
- Beta/Eta Reduction
- Variable Capture, Alpha Equivalence, and Alpha Conversion
- Normal vs. Applicative Order Evaluation
  - Call-by-name/Lazy vs. Call-by-value/Eager
- Normal Form (and W.H.N.F.) and the Church-Rosser Theorem
- Data representation: Booleans and Church Numerals
- Recursion in 位; the Y-combinator

---

# OCaml: Basic Types and Expressions

- `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `string`
- tuples (e.g., `int * int`)
- `let`/`let-in`
- `if-else`
- Type inference

---

# OCaml: Functions and Recursion

- Function definitions (and types)
- Currying and Partial application
- Pattern matching
- Polymorphism
- Recursion (Non-Tail and Tail)
  - Accumulators

---

# OCaml: Algebraic Data Types

- Type synonyms
- Basic variants
- Recursive types
- Polymorphic types
- `option`, `either`
- Data structures: `list`, `bin_tree`

---

# OCaml: Higher Order Functions

- HOF: definition
- `map` and `filter`
- `fold_right` and `fold_left`
- Generalized mapping, folding (on other data structures)
- Closures

---

# Exam Breakdown

~ 50% Multiple Choice, Matching

- Definitions, concepts, etc.

~ 50% Written Problems

- E.g., evaluating 位 expressions / OCaml programs, writing OCaml functions

---

## Written Problems
